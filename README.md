DUKPT library and tools
=======================

This library is an implementation of the ANSI X9.24-3:2017 standard for both
TDES and AES Derived Unique Key Per Transaction (DUKPT) key management. Given
that most uses of this standard involve dedicated security hardware, this
implementation is mostly for validation and debugging purposes.

If you wish to use this library for a project that is not compatible with the
terms of the LGPL v2.1 license, please contact the author for alternative
